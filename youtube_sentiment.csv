00:03:16.000 where's my package and of course there's
00:03:18.440 two overflow packages I'm going to have
00:03:21.280 to dig deep for this what the
00:03:25.680 chances even though I only have 150
00:03:28.319 stops this is what it's going to really
00:03:30.360 take time out of my
00:03:31.799 day shout out to Kean who gave me the
00:03:34.799 marker I'm going to start marking stuff
00:03:37.480 so it's easier for me to
00:03:39.120 find what is
00:03:41.200 this
00:03:44.200 142 1
00:03:53.480 198 all right it's been like 8 minutes
00:03:56.439 um still couldn't find the package but
00:03:58.840 I'm label it labeling everything so it's
00:04:02.319 easier for me to
00:04:04.940 [Music]
00:04:08.920 find this is why I hate the Amazon
00:04:11.599 navigation system so here's stop two and
00:04:13.879 we have to enter this Outlet right here
00:04:16.358 uh it's all a dead end right so stop
00:04:18.798 three was here stop four was here stop
00:04:20.918 five was here now stop six is back on
00:04:23.600 the main street but here's stop 15 and
00:04:26.639 16 where we have to come back to this
00:04:28.840 outlet and deliver these
00:04:30.950 [Music]
00:04:40.890 [Music]
00:04:51.960 packages think you find it in an Amazon
00:04:54.520 van
00:04:56.000 lemonade I'll be honest guys this just
00:04:58.720 spawned out of nowhere
00:05:00.160 if you guys haven't seen my last year's
00:05:01.919 video of prime week be sure to check
00:05:04.160 them out it's been a while since I
00:05:05.600 posted and you're all probably wondering
00:05:07.680 where I went well I just needed to
00:05:09.440 recharge you know working at Amazon 40
00:05:12.199 hours a week 10 hours a day and running
00:05:14.880 a YouTube channel can take a toll on
00:05:17.479 someone and I kind of realized it wasn't
00:05:19.400 sustainable but we are back for the
00:05:21.680 unofficial season 2 and most likely the
00:05:25.280 final season of the Amazon vlogs
00:05:29.880 every time I to get overflow I've been
00:05:31.360 struggling with this door it takes me at
00:05:33.440 least like 10 to 20 tries to open it I
00:05:38.080 don't know why and I can only go through
00:05:40.840 the back and it's just this electric
00:05:44.440 button won't
00:05:47.639 work oh my
00:05:50.080 God

00:06:36.680 no he tried attacking me wait I got this
00:06:40.440 oh no I miss the picture
00:06:43.520 gotcha look at that
00:06:49.280 photo Dam this house right here is so
00:06:52.639 nice and in their
00:06:54.919 backyard if you guys can see little
00:06:57.919 foggy
00:07:00.560 you got the view of New York
00:07:02.639 City it's a good view it's a great view
00:07:05.680 actually can you see the sweat marks on
00:07:07.840 my shirt oh this is a prime day shirt
00:07:10.400 from last year I live like in a
00:07:12.080 fortunate place where 20 minutes can get
00:07:14.080 me to New York City everything's pretty
00:07:16.240 dense pretty populated any type of food
00:07:18.639 you want you can get within like 10
00:07:20.680 miles sometimes you just got to stop and
00:07:22.680 appreciate the the little things in life
00:07:25.440 so I'm pretty much on track to finish
00:07:27.240 round like maybe like n
00:07:30.199 9ish 9900 p.m. I know that's pretty late
00:07:33.160 for most of you but for me that's a
00:07:36.479 normal
00:07:39.780 [Music]
00:07:46.919 day so yeah I think I'm going to make
00:07:48.960 maybe like 10 more videos about Amazon
00:07:51.440 and then I'm going to call it quits the
00:07:53.039 reason I started making these videos is
00:07:54.879 to show you guys what it's like to work
00:07:56.240 at Amazon so we're like 40 videos in and
00:07:59.280 I'm pretty sure you guys can get the
00:08:00.639 gist of it there are a few more things I
00:08:02.240 like to cover so for this season I'm
00:08:04.280 going to try to cover them all and along
00:08:06.159 with the Amazon Vlogs I'm going to try
00:08:08.400 diverse some things if I can keep the
00:08:10.840 content spicy so we just did stop 100
00:08:13.360 and we're stop at 101 also so
00:08:16.319 530 and by my calculations that's pretty
00:08:19.560 bad usually around 4:00 I have 100 stops
00:08:22.560 done give or take but I think it's time
00:08:25.120 for a break I ran out of water I'm
00:08:28.039 slightly hungry
00:08:30.319 let's go get something to
00:08:36.599 eat now a lot of drivers really don't
00:08:39.360 have the time to sit down and eat but I
00:08:41.719 always try to make time and I'm very big
00:08:45.000 advocate for breaks
00:08:46.760 so we are going to get some Boston
00:08:51.440 Market
00:08:53.600 hello fix the AC it's cold no not now
00:08:58.399 yeah right yeah
00:09:01.120 going to eat here yeah okay uh can I get
00:09:05.320 the half chicken with the
00:09:19.839 combos so yeah later this year I'm most
00:09:22.880 likely going to quit Amazon you know
00:09:24.760 it's my first year going to my second
00:09:26.680 year and I just don't have the same
00:09:28.880 passion as as I did once before as I
00:09:31.279 continue working these months it just
00:09:32.720 seems like I keep getting more and more
00:09:34.320 packages and I'll be honest I have my
00:09:36.320 foot out the door and every morning it
00:09:38.160 gets harder and harder to wake up to go
00:09:39.920 to work I can feel the end is near and
00:09:41.839 it's time to go which is fine because I
00:09:43.839 didn't plan to be here forever
00:09:55.670 [Music]
00:10:00.279 it's a little past Sunset
00:10:02.160 but so pretty the sky remember for every
00:10:06.560 sunset there's a
00:10:08.320 sunrise anytime you're feeling low just
00:10:10.600 know that tomorrow can be better
00:10:13.399 tomorrow is a new day so yeah this
00:10:15.800 summer has been pretty rough it's just
00:10:18.440 been heat wave after Heat Wave I think
00:10:21.519 on Tuesday it was like 97 98° Fahrenheit
00:10:27.560 for New Jersey that's pretty uncommon
00:10:29.120 but I know in Texas and Arizona pretty
00:10:31.600 common and the amount of packages as I
00:10:33.320 said we get the same amount that we did
00:10:35.600 last Peak as we do right now during
00:10:38.600 Prime day Prime week and just in summer
00:10:42.639 in general really today this my route
00:10:44.800 was packed Christmas route was
00:10:47.480 crazy it's just um I don't know even
00:10:50.639 though right now I'm
00:10:52.560 complaining Talking Magic about
00:10:55.720 Amazon I think Lok key see sometime in
00:10:59.360 near future I'll miss this
00:11:01.480 job but just a
00:11:03.800 little I just want to show you guys this
00:11:06.079 time of day in New Jersey so right now
00:11:09.760 it's pretty much dark here it's 8:48
00:11:12.120 p.m. but there's a time when it's dark
00:11:15.320 in Jersey but the sunset still hits the
00:11:17.959 buildings of New York
00:11:19.560 City and the video doesn't do it justice
00:11:23.120 but this is
00:11:25.480 pretty and after all that this is what
00:11:28.240 we're left with
00:11:35.440 so one of the last things we have to do
00:11:37.920 for the electric vans and caros is go
00:11:40.000 through the Avi tunnel this a tight
00:11:48.600 squeeze so bright takes a
00:11:52.560 picture so public service announcement
00:11:55.639 for all those delivery drivers just have
00:11:57.720 some sympathy you know If a driver walks
00:12:00.360 on your grass if he doesn't follow the
00:12:02.360 delivery notes maybe he tosses the
00:12:04.480 package like a
00:12:06.120 foot just cut them some slack I beg of
00:12:08.880 you every day we deliver to 150 200
00:12:11.720 houses minimum and it's a tough life a
00:12:14.920 lot of people don't see the hard work
00:12:16.240 that goes through the delivery system
00:12:19.320 but it is what it is you know and I hope
00:12:21.959 you guys can understand with that if you
00:12:23.560 guys learn anything new make sure you
00:12:25.920 like the video and I'll see you in the

00:00:07.520 my channel and today I'm going to be
00:00:09.679 giving you guys a
00:00:12.799 updated a updated Q&A about working at
00:00:16.920 Amazon
00:00:24.670 [Music]
00:00:30.359 this is the truth about
00:00:32.238 Amazon um these are all your questions
00:00:36.040 that you still leave me from a video
00:00:40.960 videos that I've done years ago one
00:00:43.600 thing that I will say is I no longer
00:00:45.680 work at Amazon but I still constantly
00:00:48.640 get questions that I do try to answer
00:00:51.280 sometimes I don't be seeing the
00:00:52.879 questions but um I think I am more than
00:00:56.199 qualified I know that I'm more than
00:00:58.359 qualified to answer you guys questions
00:01:01.160 I've been working at Amazon on and off
00:01:03.399 since I was like
00:01:04.799 19
00:01:06.720 um and it's a lot it does have some good
00:01:10.720 benefits that being said I did write
00:01:13.360 some of the questions that I've seen on
00:01:16.360 my YouTube platform and I just wrote
00:01:18.280 them down so I'm just going to try to
00:01:20.240 give you guys as much information and
00:01:22.360 clarity as I can I get the same
00:01:24.880 repetitive com um questions pertaining
00:01:28.759 Amazon and
00:01:30.640 all that good stuff so we're just going
00:01:31.920 to get right into it this video is not
00:01:33.880 going to be long at all it's definitely
00:01:35.479 going to be short put all of the
00:01:38.439 information I know and what I have
00:01:41.759 experienced at the Amazon buildings that
00:01:44.159 I worked at cuz your girl has worked at
00:01:46.479 like four or five buildings already
00:01:49.040 they're all somewhat different but one
00:01:50.840 in the same so yeah so the first thing
00:01:55.039 is the question that I see a lot is do
00:01:57.799 we have to take a drug test
00:02:00.520 no uh when I was working at Amazon we
00:02:04.920 did had to take a drug test but that was
00:02:08.840 during like Co
00:02:12.520 um yeah so no you don't have to take a
00:02:16.080 drug test um as well as they do not drug
00:02:21.160 you I mean girl what they do not test
00:02:24.800 you for weed or anything like that now
00:02:28.040 since I do not work there and I haven't
00:02:29.640 work work there in about a year um
00:02:32.640 things can a so Mark me if I am wrong if
00:02:36.400 you need to take a drug test but from my
00:02:38.560 understanding
00:02:41.000 no two where uh the other question that
00:02:45.760 I usually get is what do I wear to my
00:02:47.800 pre hire
00:02:49.040 appointment what you wear is casual
00:02:51.400 clothes you don't need to come into you
00:02:53.400 don't need to go in business attire you
00:02:56.159 don't need to do like a fancy casual
00:02:58.480 type of thing unless you just dress like
00:03:00.840 that but it's casual a shirt pants
00:03:04.959 sweater not sweater beanie no beanie um
00:03:09.840 so whatever you want to wear is
00:03:13.480 fine uh another question that I also get
00:03:16.400 is what do I need to bring what you need
00:03:18.640 to bring is the important documents that
00:03:21.200 they tell you to bring so you need to
00:03:22.799 bring your social security card and or
00:03:26.400 ID so you need both or if you don't have
00:03:30.120 your social you need your um birth
00:03:34.000 certificate and or
00:03:37.120 ID okay so you need to you need some
00:03:40.760 type of form of proof that you are who
00:03:45.080 you say you are so it could be birth
00:03:46.840 certificate and Social Security card or
00:03:50.120 it can be ID and social or birth
00:03:54.159 certificate and ID um either or as long
00:03:58.480 as you have two documents please do not
00:04:00.799 bring one to your preh hire appointment
00:04:03.680 because they will turn you back and they
00:04:05.599 will tell you that you need two and you
00:04:07.959 have to stand in that long line again
00:04:11.079 when will you start so when you do apply
00:04:16.000 for the job you are picking your own
00:04:18.519 schedule so it's a 4day schedule and
00:04:22.759 then it's 3 days
00:04:24.960 off so um it could be Wednesday Thursday
00:04:29.479 Friday Friday Saturday and then you have
00:04:31.680 Sunday Monday Tuesday off or you can
00:04:35.000 work Monday Tuesday Wednesday Monday
00:04:37.840 Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and have
00:04:40.000 Friday Saturday Sunday off but with the
00:04:43.280 Monday through Thursday schedule it
00:04:46.280 usually never happens because they
00:04:48.160 always need people on the weekends so it
00:04:50.720 just all depends on what days they need
00:04:53.080 you for and if it's part-time or
00:04:55.320 full-time stuff like that as far as when
00:05:00.120 will you start you will get an email
00:05:03.320 that you have to go to your pre hire
00:05:05.199 appointment once you do that boom you're
00:05:07.440 finish you already got the job um and
00:05:11.039 then they will give you a updated email
00:05:13.000 on when you start they will give you a
00:05:14.800 start date sometimes you don't start
00:05:17.440 that specific date sometimes you start
00:05:19.080 earlier and sometimes you start later
00:05:21.000 depending on the building but usually
00:05:23.319 within that week you
00:05:25.479 start so it really depends on the
00:05:27.800 building on how fast they need employ
00:05:30.199 to start working for them um are you
00:05:33.120 going to be able to have a actual
00:05:35.560 schedule change so like I said um when
00:05:38.639 you do apply originally when you
00:05:41.000 originally apply for the job you are
00:05:43.960 already picking your days and you are
00:05:45.759 already picking your schedule so when
00:05:47.840 you pick your schedule um whether it's
00:05:52.039 Monday through Thursday or Thursday
00:05:55.199 Friday Saturday
00:05:57.319 Sunday um just depending on what days
00:06:00.680 you know you work that's your schedule
00:06:02.600 for the meantime so if you do go in
00:06:05.720 part-time or you go in full time no
00:06:08.160 matter what if that's your schedule
00:06:09.919 that's your schedule y'all the wind
00:06:12.080 knocked my camera like crazy okay um
00:06:16.560 let's talk about eternal transfers so
00:06:19.440 basically Eternal transfers are
00:06:21.319 transfers are changing to a different
00:06:23.520 department so you do have to do a it's a
00:06:27.039 waiting period with that um once you get
00:06:29.840 and once you have your schedule once you
00:06:31.759 let's just say you're in inbound right
00:06:33.960 and you want to change to outbound you
00:06:35.599 do have to wait a specific amount of
00:06:37.400 time for you to do an internal transfer
00:06:41.280 okay so is it a one-on-one interview no
00:06:43.599 it is not with Amazon everybody knows is
00:06:46.479 once you pick your own schedule and you
00:06:49.840 do the prehired appointment you already
00:06:52.039 got the job there's no oneon-one
00:06:54.280 interview there's no nothing like that
00:06:57.879 but when I used to work they used to
00:06:59.039 hire people every week and now I haven't
00:07:01.919 seen Amazon hire in specifically in my
00:07:05.280 location for like about a year so it
00:07:08.160 just all depends on like the location
00:07:10.319 and stuff like that but you stand in
00:07:11.759 this line and then you take your picture
00:07:14.319 you show them your social security and
00:07:16.080 birth certificate and or ID they tell
00:07:19.280 you what location and what you're going
00:07:21.039 to be doing um on the site so that's how
00:07:24.440 that works someone asked on my video is
00:07:27.080 do you need a bank account yeah you're I
00:07:30.240 mean you don't really need a big account
00:07:32.039 and the reason why I would suggest
00:07:33.599 getting one is because um it will tell
00:07:37.160 you if you want your actual check in
00:07:39.080 person and you do this online as well by
00:07:42.199 the way they will send you an email and
00:07:44.879 all this stuff is set up online it's not
00:07:47.039 set up in person like they used to
00:07:48.919 anymore um but
00:07:51.159 basically uh they will tell you if you
00:07:53.280 want your check in person or you want to
00:07:56.280 set up direct deposit and let's just say
00:07:58.599 if you don't have a big account they do
00:08:00.479 have um a actual like card that they pay
00:08:03.680 you through through their company um if
00:08:06.520 you choose to go that route as far as
00:08:09.680 can you listen to music like on the
00:08:11.520 floor no you cannot I remember during Co
00:08:14.560 we were allowed to um use our phones on
00:08:18.240 the floor I don't know if that changed
00:08:20.039 so please you guys let me know like I
00:08:22.479 said I do have sorry that's my nephew I
00:08:25.520 do have other videos pertaining Amazon
00:08:28.319 and whatnot so please feel free to go
00:08:30.800 back to that video to get a little bit
00:08:32.919 more information but I wanted to do a
00:08:34.599 updated um question Q&A because of the
00:08:38.159 fact that I get
00:08:41.039 so I get so many questions about it um
00:08:44.320 do I miss working at
00:08:46.000 Amazon a little bit but at the same time
00:08:49.120 no I'm in a whole different era like I'm
00:08:51.160 a mom now you guys I have a whole child
00:08:53.920 on the way a baby girl if you guys I'm
00:08:56.160 going promote myself if you guys have
00:08:57.720 not seen my pregnant videos please go
00:09:00.519 watch that and do me a huge favor please
00:09:03.920 um but yeah would I ever work at Amazon
00:09:07.399 again um I really don't think so
00:09:10.480 Warehouse just never been my type of
00:09:12.880 vibe um but what I say did I find
00:09:16.480 enjoyment at my last my last uh site I
00:09:20.079 really did honestly I surrounded myself
00:09:22.480 with nothing but positivity I was I had
00:09:24.640 a very positive mindset and that's one
00:09:27.079 thing that I do want to encourage you
00:09:29.000 all whoever is applying thinking about
00:09:31.560 applying to Amazon are currently about
00:09:34.279 to you know work at Amazon um have a
00:09:37.959 positive mindset make sure you drink
00:09:39.920 water Amazon is your workout especially
00:09:42.560 when you are doing I mean whether you're
00:09:45.079 doing outbound or inbound it's still a
00:09:47.360 workout regardless but make sure that
00:09:49.600 you fixate your mind in a positive um
00:09:53.399 mindset because if you're being negative
00:09:55.800 and if you're saying like oh this is not
00:09:57.200 for me and this is too hard and this is
00:09:59.880 slave work and all this stuff like all
00:10:02.440 that is just very negative and you're
00:10:04.079 going to quit you know what I'm saying
00:10:06.079 um keep in mind as far as the hours too
00:10:09.200 that's something I want to talk about
00:10:11.680 peak season is around the corner so get
00:10:14.079 ready and buckle up
00:10:15.839 to uh ice your feet take some nice hot
00:10:19.880 baths uh because peak season you're
00:10:22.160 either working 10hour shifts are 12-hour
00:10:24.120 shifts I will say they aren't that bad
00:10:26.480 when you have a positive mindset and as
00:10:29.000 well as you could sneak stuff in as far
00:10:31.519 as like um when I worked there I used to
00:10:34.040 have like a uh it was it played music it
00:10:37.120 was a headband and it played music um I
00:10:40.240 remember somebody commented on my video
00:10:42.920 um like oh don't listen to her because
00:10:45.760 um you could get fired for wearing a
00:10:47.399 headband no you cannot get for one they
00:10:49.519 cannot tell you that you cannot wear a
00:10:51.800 headband what I did was I will wear the
00:10:54.320 gray headband and then I will put a
00:10:55.920 black one over it because they look like
00:10:58.079 a regular headband you know know what
00:10:59.440 I'm saying
00:11:00.680 so yeah they can't fire you for wearing
00:11:03.079 a headband um but I used to sneak my
00:11:05.600 airpods in I Used To You Know cover my
00:11:08.000 hair as far as all you guys all you
00:11:10.160 ladies with long hair as well make sure
00:11:12.800 that you guys have to tie it up um but
00:11:15.800 honestly me personally I did not listen
00:11:18.440 they didn't really care the building
00:11:20.240 that I was at they were very lenient um
00:11:22.600 but I will say it's lowkey kind of fun
00:11:24.320 like during peak season as well because
00:11:27.279 sometimes like after your shift they'll
00:11:29.040 have like pies like full pies that you
00:11:32.000 can take home to your family or or
00:11:35.079 they'll have like goodie bags and stuff
00:11:37.040 like that or like your favorite like
00:11:39.279 co-workers or whatever they'll bring you
00:11:40.920 stuff like it's pretty cool it's fun you
00:11:42.600 just got to make it like you have to
00:11:44.600 make it fun for yourself and you can't
00:11:46.720 dwell on negativity you can't dwell on
00:11:49.120 other people negative mindset because
00:11:51.240 that will hinder um you know your growth
00:11:54.519 on if you want to grow in Amazon because
00:11:57.160 it's a possibility of course that you
00:11:59.600 can grow um as far as oh what to take
00:12:03.880 like when you have lunch and stuff like
00:12:05.680 that I would highly suggest packing your
00:12:07.480 meals because the Venom machine although
00:12:11.000 that little $2 $3 sounds good in the
00:12:13.560 moment when you're hungry all that stuff
00:12:15.639 adds up and I definitely will say pack
00:12:18.600 your lunch they do provide fridges and
00:12:20.639 everything but I would take a lunch box
00:12:23.399 to where it has a lock on it um because
00:12:26.160 people do steal it's a real thing people
00:12:29.199 do still you know people food people do
00:12:31.880 you don't know what people do when you
00:12:33.800 are away because everybody have
00:12:35.720 different lunches keep so be aware of
00:12:38.160 that um so pack your lunch and be
00:12:41.760 positive and I will recommend to
00:12:44.240 flourish okay to you know not just be in
00:12:48.000 everybody face but uh do what you need
00:12:50.440 to do go in work and go out um if you
00:12:53.600 decide to flourish and you know talk to
00:12:57.760 people I would have recommend that just
00:13:00.120 make sure that they are positive but
00:13:02.000 other than that I hope you guys enjoyed
00:13:03.399 this video and um let me know what you

3,"00:00:00.080 and nobody will say anything but I'm
00:00:04.000 about to get ready to go into the
00:00:05.520 building I will come back on my lunch
00:00:09.120 break or my break and talk to yall a
00:00:12.200 little bit I ain't sure yet but I'll see
00:00:14.160 y'all in a
00:00:16.490 [Music]
00:00:23.560 bit hey y'all so it is our break time as
00:00:27.199 you see I got my airpods in my ear my
00:00:30.160 hair is covering it crazy thing is I was
00:00:33.040 St on
00:00:34.600 K easy everything going smooth then I
00:00:38.640 was asked to be moved to a get to a boo
00:00:43.280 cool crazy boxes
00:00:46.199 Galore I didn't plan to sweat I didn't
00:00:48.920 plan to work hard today your girl forgot
00:00:50.879 to put some deodorant
00:00:52.480 on I don't stink but I got some in my
00:00:54.840 truck I'm about to put it on now baby
00:00:56.920 when I tell you I can't be musty
00:01:00.760 but we about to get
00:01:16.720 it all right y'all so it is 8:58 y'all I
00:01:20.840 didn't got off came the waterburger as
00:01:23.360 you can see got me something to eat I'm
00:01:25.360 waiting on my fries so they going to be
00:01:27.040 fresh I am ready for them I ended up
00:01:29.280 getting me a chicken strip sandwich
00:01:31.640 y'all comment below and let me know if
00:01:33.000 y'all like that cuz your girl is hungry
00:01:35.000 I ate early yesterday I didn't eat a
00:01:37.520 lunch during my Amazon break or my lunch
00:01:40.000 so I am extremely hungry now so I'm
00:01:43.000 getting me something to eat then I'm
00:01:44.439 about to go to my second job change
00:01:46.560 clothes and go into the office I'm not
00:01:48.880 sure if I want to change in the bathroom
00:01:50.719 or change my truck but I probably end up
00:01:53.640 going into the office logging into my
00:01:56.799 computer going into the bathroom
00:01:59.119 freshening up changing my clothes and
00:02:01.399 then coming back to work so I will see
00:02:04.159 y'all in a bit hey y'all I'm on my
00:02:06.360 little break my first break it's a
00:02:07.920 little after 1:00 I get off at 4: um I'm
00:02:12.760 sitting outside cuz I was falling asleep
00:02:14.879 behind the desk on my computer I was
00:02:17.800 nodding like every few minutes I was
00:02:19.959 putting my hands on my head going to
00:02:21.480 sleep so I kind of stepped outside to
00:02:24.319 get some air and kind of wake up a
00:02:26.879 little bit and I'm covering my shirt up
00:02:30.560 because I don't want y'all to know
00:02:31.800 exactly where I work at and we going to
00:02:33.840 get this day started so I'll see y'all
00:02:35.640 in a bit I'mma give you a peep of what
00:02:38.280 the inside looks like these are the bags
00:02:40.760 we got to put the boxes in and those at
00:02:43.400 the end of the aisle where we put the
00:02:45.040 oversized boxes right there is where we
00:02:47.599 grab the boxes from to put into the bags
00:02:51.900 [Music]
00:03:24.640 all right y'all so it's 6:04 I'm on my
00:03:27.239 lunch things are a little bit hectic
00:03:30.319 now they don't allow you to have your
00:03:31.920 airpods in your ear they don't want you
00:03:33.680 to have your phone on the floor pretty
00:03:35.560 much no airpods in your ear so it's kind
00:03:38.120 of hard to get a lot of footage inside I
00:03:40.519 think a lot of people quit because now
00:03:42.080 they're offering more shifts to the flex
00:03:43.959 schedule at first our schedules were
00:03:46.040 only Friday Saturday Sunday now they're
00:03:48.879 offering shifts during the week which is
00:03:50.959 weird so I'm going to pick up some
00:03:52.959 shifts during the week and then go from
00:03:56.360 there
00:04:00.360 another thing is it seems like we have
00:04:02.079 new management which
00:04:04.280 is I don't know crazy right but the
00:04:08.120 leadership team that I met today is
00:04:10.079 pretty cool you know they were down to
00:04:12.159 earth trying to they have this new sto
00:04:15.280 thing called smart sto and smart St is
00:04:18.120 where you put all the boxes for a you
00:04:20.079 put all the boxes for b c d whatever on
00:04:23.840 your cart and it makes you makes it
00:04:26.800 makes you Stow faster which is what they
00:04:29.360 want they want you to store the boxes
00:04:31.639 100 miles an hour which is impossible
00:04:34.880 but some people y'all some people sto
00:04:39.000 and move quick in here I'm not giving
00:04:41.160 them all my energy you know so I did
00:04:43.720 record this
00:04:46.479 guy I probably shouldn't have but I did
00:04:48.720 record this guy walking out and when I
00:04:52.360 tell y'all he moves like that all the
00:04:54.720 time his whole shift like I need to know
00:04:57.199 what he own and what he got like how you
00:05:00.199 moving that fast for eight hours or
00:05:03.320 whatever your shift is come on like look
00:05:06.520 now y'all tell me if he ain't moving
00:05:09.120 fast like he passed all of us up he was
00:05:11.120 way in the back on like Jay and by the
00:05:13.400 time I clocked out he was in his car
00:05:16.600 already crazy but I'll see y a little
00:05:19.639 bit later bye right here is where I show
00:05:23.280 you you put your oversized boxes and
00:05:26.160 those bins right there because they
00:05:27.680 don't fit in the bags or you put them on
00:05:30.240 the outside of the aisle if the bins are
00:05:32.720 full and somebody will come pick them up
00:05:35.800 and put them
00:05:37.199 in line for the trucks we are on another
00:05:41.800 break right here as you see people are
00:05:44.479 sitting in their car some people are
00:05:46.280 getting ready to
00:05:47.479 leave I ended up leaving for that
00:05:54.800 day all right y'all it's 8:50 I am off
00:05:57.880 of work I made it through the night the
00:06:00.680 morning whatever you want to call it I
00:06:03.120 am about to go home take a shower lay
00:06:06.360 down for a little bit as you can see
00:06:08.120 I've been sweating it was hella hot in
00:06:09.919 there my face is breaking out from that
00:06:12.360 mask so all right y'all so it's another
00:06:14.960 shift I left the house it is raining I
00:06:17.880 hate driving in the rain but you got to
00:06:20.360 do what you got to do to get that money
00:06:22.520 so we are on our way and as you see in a
00:06:24.759 little bit it's about to stop raining
00:06:27.680 and it's not going to be drop on my
00:06:33.040 [Music]
00:06:40.800 windshield I ended up running a little
00:06:43.080 bit late because it was raining at my
00:06:44.880 house but you're going to be able to see
00:06:46.919 when I pull up in Amazon the parking lot
00:06:48.880 is already going to have cars there so
00:06:51.000 the later you get there the further you
00:06:53.360 park away from the entrance door and I
00:06:55.919 usually try to get there early because I
00:06:58.120 don't like the park for especially if
00:06:59.960 it's raining and it's cold because I
00:07:01.720 take my breaks and my lunches in my
00:07:03.879 truck so you're going to be able to see
00:07:06.120 that in just a second
00:07:08.490 [Music]
00:07:35.240 all right I'm about to start walking
00:07:37.000 into the building and you're going to
00:07:38.360 see I have on some different shoes but
00:07:40.560 you got to kind of watch so they don't
00:07:42.319 look at your feet because they will send
00:07:44.000 you home those steel toe shoes are
00:07:48.000 painful like I hate wearing them so I
00:07:50.319 try to wear what I want to wear but they
00:07:52.879 if they catch you like I said they'll
00:07:54.400 send you home and I'm late so I'm going
00:07:57.400 to be going like further back I usually
00:08:00.039 get there early so I'm stowing In Like A
00:08:02.680 B C D but I think today I ended up going
00:08:06.599 into G and as you see me walking a
00:08:09.360 little bit further back I believe I show
00:08:11.240 y'all what all I'm going to be stowing
00:08:13.120 in
00:08:17.650 [Music]
00:08:45.340 [Music]
00:08:54.760 all right I should be getting close to
00:08:56.920 where I am going to be stowing and
00:09:01.440 it's early so the the aisles aren't too
00:09:04.240 bad so I'm walking around going to find
00:09:08.320 just what area I want to go into I
00:09:10.440 usually pick the ones that are not bad
00:09:12.880 that is a speaker they usually have
00:09:14.320 music playing Extremely Loud you get a
00:09:16.920 cart and you start putting your boxes on
00:09:19.160 the cart I believe I kind of show y'all
00:09:21.600 how to do it in this video you end up
00:09:24.920 scanning a tag on the box oh right there
00:09:28.360 yep and then once you scan that tag on
00:09:30.800 the box the light of the back kind of
00:09:34.440 lights up and it tells you where to put
00:09:37.360 it at so it's very simple working at
00:09:39.760 Amazon and basically you want to make
00:09:42.040 sure your boxes are put in there neat
00:09:44.839 because it is going to be a ton of boxes
00:09:47.680 that go in that bag and your oversized
00:09:50.120 boxes go in those bins right there or at
00:09:52.399 the end of the aisle if you run out of
00:09:54.040 room
00:10:01.000 and right here I'm putting the finger
00:10:02.720 scanner on basically you just put it on
00:10:05.000 your finger and you press down and it
00:10:08.360 actually scans the box and then the Box
00:10:12.160 tells you where it's supposed to go
00:10:14.480 pretty much sometimes you get bags on
00:10:16.959 the other aisle if you don't have
00:10:18.480 anything lightened up so you would have
00:10:20.200 to look on the scanner to see where it
00:10:22.959 goes and pretty much find it or you can
00:10:26.160 say it on below there and put it back
00:10:28.560 but if PR in that aisle of G then I'll
00:10:31.959 I'll go search for it and put it up cuz
00:10:34.200 it doesn't make sense to keep putting it
00:10:36.000 back and sending it to another aisle
00:10:38.399 that's just crazy to me
00:10:41.480 but I'm explaining it here basically
00:10:44.440 everything I just said and it's like I
00:10:46.600 said pretty simple and self-explanatory
00:10:51.810 [Music]
00:11:14.490 [Music]

6,"00:00:00.000 all right What up YouTube i'm going to
00:00:01.760 show you guys a little bit of what to do
00:00:06.400 as a hostel driver at Amazon for
00:00:10.120 transportation I accepted a
00:00:13.400 move I'm going to parking zip
00:00:16.600 479 Uh no I'm not parking tip 479 I'm
00:00:20.240 going to uh the dog door So once you
00:00:23.279 inspect the
00:00:24.359 trailer you come back and you get your
00:00:26.800 Tommy phone and you
00:00:30.119 uh
00:00:31.640 document that there's no issues I got to
00:00:34.079 run and get a different radio Copy that
00:00:37.040 You uh got to document that you got to
00:00:40.000 do there's no issues with the trailer
00:00:43.120 And if there is issues with the trailer
00:00:45.600 you'll go here and you'll put what's
00:00:48.079 wrong with it But since there's no issue
00:00:53.960 here they're arguing over the radio Why
00:00:57.120 i don't
00:01:01.239 know And then okay you put on your
00:01:04.640 gloves This is part of your
00:01:09.720 PPE So how is your guys's day going
00:01:12.320 comment below what what you guys are up
00:01:14.560 to What's all the [ __ ] going oh crap
00:01:18.560 Going
00:01:21.400 around So uh there's only two ways to uh
00:01:25.360 park a trailer at a dog or at a parking
00:01:28.040 slip Uh Amazon policy we are not we are
00:01:31.840 not allowed to do a alley dog So we
00:01:35.759 either do a S turn or a U or a J turn A
00:01:39.759 J turn I want to say it's a U-turn
00:01:42.680 Uh going doing a S turn is uh you're
00:01:45.759 pulling up on the same side as a parking
00:01:48.720 slip or the dog door You go up two slips
00:01:51.680 or two dock doors and then you crank it
00:01:55.920 all the way to the right Then you crank
00:01:57.840 it all the way to the left Then you are
00:02:00.079 at an angle It's It's easier to share
00:02:02.479 than It's easier It would have been good
00:02:04.640 if I if I have a camera man where they
00:02:06.880 can show you
00:02:08.038 guys I just No I'm scared Um like here
00:02:12.400 at BFL1 here at uh the ground is uneven
00:02:17.360 so sometimes you got to pick up the
00:02:19.120 trailer more Right now I'm not sure if
00:02:20.879 you guys were able to hear it but
00:02:22.840 anyways Um yeah you can only do a S turn
00:02:26.239 or U-turn Uh our benchmark is uh 10
00:02:29.360 minutes I could do it in five but
00:02:33.519 um the more the faster I do it the less
00:02:36.080 moves other people do And to be honest
00:02:38.879 um yeah No I got tired of doing
00:02:40.800 everybody's job So f
00:02:44.599 that Now you guys come with me to go do
00:02:49.560 this Then right here I'm going to a dog
00:02:52.480 door This is a hustler I'm going to cut
00:02:55.920 the w the
00:02:57.400 seal All right So now I go I walk to the
00:03:00.640 back of the trailer and then Yeah I'm
00:03:02.959 going to cut the seal I'm going to open
00:03:04.080 up the doors I'm going to park the
00:03:05.519 trailer You know what I mean and I park
00:03:07.519 it real
00:03:09.720 fast So now I'm going to cut the
00:03:14.840 seal Then this
00:03:16.840 seal you put it in a
00:03:19.400 bucket All right You put it in a bucket
00:03:22.080 You don't throw it away in a trash can
00:03:24.080 or you don't throw it away in the in the
00:03:26.159 on the on the on the floor or in the
00:03:30.879 trailer No you put it in a bucket It's
00:03:34.000 called F RFID bucket some crap like that
00:03:38.159 All right hold
00:03:47.159 on All right Then I open up the other
00:03:49.920 door First you open up the passenger
00:03:53.280 side door Then you open up the the
00:03:55.280 driver's side And to close it you close
00:03:56.959 the driver's side first and then the
00:03:58.799 passenger side first Second uh make sure
00:04:01.439 that you guys are open-minded and um you
00:04:04.400 guys aren't quick
00:04:05.640 because I'm the type that doesn't have
00:04:07.920 patience to be training people and I
00:04:09.840 happen to be a PD a PD teacher which
00:04:12.959 means I train before the hospital but
00:04:17.040 um I'm not really a good trainer to be
00:04:18.639 honest
00:04:20.690 [Music]
00:04:26.320 Now that the doors are open I grab my
00:04:30.199 seal I grab my wire cutters I grab my
00:04:34.000 phone I can't leave it on the on the
00:04:35.440 freaking trailer because if I leave it
00:04:36.560 on the trailer I got to get a new hat
00:04:38.360 because this was already faded and
00:04:40.639 everything So here's this yard See this
00:04:44.240 is how it looks Beautiful isn't
00:04:47.240 it uh and to be honest I only weigh 90
00:04:50.240 lbs I look fat on the camera but I don't
00:04:52.000 I'm not that fat No I'm just kidding I
00:04:53.680 am fat
00:04:56.280 Now
00:04:58.280 then you get this So right now I'm doing
00:05:01.199 a S turn I'm doing a S turn So I'm going
00:05:04.880 to explain to you guys what I'm going to
00:05:06.800 do All right Right now I'm literally
00:05:08.720 parked straight Now I crank it all the
00:05:12.639 way to the right All the
00:05:15.639 way All the way All the way All the way
00:05:18.960 Now literally right now I'm like this
00:05:22.000 The trailer and then my leg cap is like
00:05:24.000 this Then once I'm like that I pull
00:05:25.919 forward a little bit straight Then I go
00:05:28.320 all the way to the left Not all the way
00:05:30.560 a little bit Then I come all the way
00:05:31.759 back to the right Everybody has their
00:05:33.280 own technique to be to techniques to be
00:05:35.360 honest
00:05:37.080 Uh I want to say honestly like I'm not
00:05:39.680 trying to like whatever but my technique
00:05:42.000 I want to say is the easiest and the
00:05:43.280 simplest
00:05:47.000 way Then you get in front of your
00:05:50.919 trailer Then you see Okay So I was
00:05:54.240 trying to do it in one shot but I
00:05:55.360 couldn't because I'm not I'm not that
00:05:56.800 good at at I'm still a
00:06:00.840 rookie I'm just I'm not
00:06:06.280 a It's just where uh this doctor is the
00:06:09.280 last doctor of the building So there is
00:06:11.600 not enough room to go up two slips
00:06:16.840 Um and since I'm explaining it to you
00:06:19.120 guys and I'm going a little slower than
00:06:20.400 usual um like I can't get it in one shot
00:06:24.080 I guess I'm just making up
00:06:26.840 excuses right like
00:06:30.600 uh but if you guys are watching my
00:06:32.800 videos comment down below and comment
00:06:35.120 and let me know where you guys are
00:06:36.160 watching me
00:06:37.880 from I want to know where uh you guys
00:06:40.160 are watching me from I want to know if
00:06:41.280 there's Amazon at your guys's city It's
00:06:44.000 [ __ ] hot though
00:06:53.880 man All
00:06:55.560 right I got the trailer I've been record
00:06:58.800 I I started this video 7 minutes ago So
00:07:02.720 that means I've been here for
00:07:07.479 uh there's no more moves So now I'm
00:07:11.120 going to literally just go and park on
00:07:12.800 the shade cuz the ACs on this freaking
00:07:16.919 Hustlers they're not so great to be
00:07:19.360 honest with you guys Um and my fan on
00:07:22.479 top of the Hustler there's a little fan
00:07:24.560 but it's not it doesn't work so good to
00:07:26.319 be honest It's not great at all Um now
00:07:30.479 I'm going to just go look for a parking
00:07:32.599 spot and just park there But instead of
00:07:36.000 parking there I think I'm gonna just go
00:07:38.039 inside where there's
00:07:40.199 ACs because it is hot now I'm starting
00:07:44.000 to sweat
00:07:46.039 But now that the heat is
00:07:49.160 starting I'm going to Now that's the
00:07:51.840 only reason why I'm not going Are you
00:07:54.000 guys
00:07:54.759 okay are you guys good or did you guys
00:07:56.879 hurt yourself now that um now that it's
00:07:59.520 hot to be honest with you guys I'm not
00:08:00.879 going to be going as fast anymore I used
00:08:03.039 to do five minute moves but I'm not
00:08:05.599 going to do that anymore
00:08:06.919 because it's hot and I'm the type that
00:08:09.199 sweats a lot So I won't be doing that no
00:08:12.199 more Oh here's my water It just it has
00:08:15.440 we have nowhere to put it at So I had
00:08:17.680 that I kept falling So I have it up
00:08:20.240 there but it bothers me that it hits the
00:08:22.800 window too much
00:08:41.120 But yeah um let me know I had gotten a
00:08:45.279 comment just to to explain how do I park
00:08:47.200 a trailer cuz someone got an offer later
00:08:50.480 I hope this helped a little bit I mean
00:08:52.720 obviously it didn't help at all because
00:08:54.560 I didn't show you guys
00:08:57.560 anything
00:09:01.959 but as long as you're paying no
00:09:03.920 attention to what I'm
00:09:05.320 saying on day one of
00:09:07.959 transportation when they explain it to
00:09:10.160 you you're going to be like you're going
00:09:10.880 to have a little you're going to be
00:09:12.120 familiar familiar with what I'm saying
00:09:14.800 So you're going to be able to like say
00:09:16.160 ""Oh yeah the U-turn the S
00:09:18.519 turnah."" And then you'll be a little bit
00:09:20.880 better
00:09:22.160 cuz I want to say that they offered you
00:09:23.760 a letter right so I want to say they
00:09:26.720 gave you an offer letter and someone
00:09:28.240 else I don't think they just hired you
00:09:30.000 I'm pretty sure they hired more than one
00:09:32.040 person At least that's what I'm assuming
00:09:34.320 because that's basically how it is Just
00:09:36.399 in case you don't make the
00:09:38.279 cut which you got to make the cut bro
00:09:40.720 You got to [ __ ] make it And if you
00:09:42.320 make it come back and comment and be
00:09:43.680 like ""Hey bro I made that [ __ ] I mean I
00:09:45.680 made that I'm the best now."" All right
00:09:49.600 Um and
00:09:52.440 yeah I'm in
00:09:55.959 California so the starting pay here is
00:10:00.600 23 [ __ ] What is it it's
00:10:03.399 2375 I want to
00:10:06.519 say Oh
00:10:08.680 25 They just they raised it They raised
00:10:11.440 it already I don't know what's the
00:10:12.320 starting pay cuz when I was
00:10:15.399 here cuz I'm above uh
00:10:20.440 26 to be
00:10:24.839 honest
00:10:27.800 but you go up every six months on the
00:10:31.160 pay So right now I'm
00:10:36.519 at No I can't tell you guys
00:10:42.720 But it is
00:10:44.040 above for sure it's above
00:10:46.440 25 I live in
00:10:48.920 California I don't know about other

7,"00:00:00.800 hey I'm just off my Flex shift uh at the
00:00:04.799 fulfillment center I work at um and
00:00:08.480 interestingly enough Amazon has another
00:00:11.040 position called Flex Driver which uses
00:00:14.080 the Flex app and the drivers can pick up
00:00:17.920 um blocks of um time which would they
00:00:21.119 want to uh that they according to their
00:00:24.400 preference where they'll deliver
00:00:26.080 packages
00:00:27.920 it's a really good uh gig actually and
00:00:31.519 um I think it's four to six hours or
00:00:34.399 something like that you go to a
00:00:36.079 sortation site you load your vehicle
00:00:39.120 with the packages and then you just
00:00:40.960 follow the navigation um step by step
00:00:44.079 they'll uh coach you on which drop is
00:00:48.480 next where to go and if you have any
00:00:50.800 issues there's a really great uh system
00:00:53.120 of communicating with um the help desk
00:00:57.440 or whatever but I'm working uh at a
00:01:00.160 fulfillment center as a flex worker and
00:01:03.120 that's similar to um PIM I suppose you
00:01:05.600 could call it where you can pick up
00:01:07.600 blocks of time you have to take at least
00:01:11.040 four hours a week uh if you don't pick
00:01:16.119 up four at least four hours a week you
00:01:19.600 automatically uh pick up two points
00:01:22.320 against you and as a flex worker you get
00:01:25.439 a total of eight
00:01:27.720 points after which you fall into a zone
00:01:30.560 where they're um eligible to fire
00:01:34.119 you and you use your point system for
00:01:37.799 sick time for um late time and all this
00:01:43.000 um as a flex worker you only have a
00:01:46.320 point system and paid time off as um
00:01:51.399 options um to to utilize um for sick and
00:01:56.479 being late and going out early and
00:01:58.320 things like that pay time off a cruise I
00:02:01.280 think at 17 minutes per 4 hours
00:02:04.640 something just over 3
00:02:06.680 minutes an hour something like that
00:02:11.280 and it's pretty decent where um I've
00:02:14.480 been able to for instance yesterday I
00:02:17.520 had acrewed 13 minutes
00:02:21.040 uh and today I acrewed another 17 and so
00:02:24.000 I was able to leave um just over 20
00:02:26.640 minutes early um it just feels good it
00:02:29.680 gives you that um uh feeling of um
00:02:35.440 uh you're in control of your your time
00:02:38.319 and your schedule and if um you're not
00:02:41.599 feeling it at work or whatever you can
00:02:43.440 take a few minutes off without having to
00:02:46.160 ask anybody i mean the managers ask for
00:02:49.040 I think it's 1 hour notice um and you
00:02:51.920 just write your your badge
00:02:54.480 identification up on the whiteboard just
00:02:56.640 to let them know what time you're
00:02:58.080 leaving but really uh you don't have to
00:03:01.360 ask permission or nothing you just uh go
00:03:05.200 off of the A Toz app and you calculate
00:03:10.239 your own paid time off uh how many
00:03:13.200 points you have and uh if you're a able
00:03:19.560 to take off earlier come in later um
00:03:23.280 anything like that
00:03:25.319 so I've acreded
00:03:29.239 uh one of my points dropped off today so
00:03:32.959 I had acred four points and I think they
00:03:36.319 stay on your
00:03:39.400 um your profile for two months and then
00:03:44.480 they drop off and so it feels like
00:03:46.879 forever for them to drop off but
00:03:50.200 uh it feels good i had one point drop
00:03:53.519 off today okay so I'm down to
00:03:55.480 three and uh it really is your sick sick
00:04:01.360 option if you're sick you can't come
00:04:03.439 into work you have an emergency uh you
00:04:06.480 take a point and it sounds
00:04:11.159 um
00:04:13.400 negative like oh I have a point against
00:04:16.560 me but it shouldn't really you shouldn't
00:04:18.798 really be feeling like it's a negative
00:04:21.839 thing because it's actually just uh the
00:04:26.400 option they've given flex workers for um
00:04:30.320 sick sick sick time whereas their other
00:04:33.680 positions their regular full-time

00:05:04.240 I come in late can I leave early i have
00:05:06.400 this going on that going on uh trying to
00:05:09.360 convince somebody you're really sick you
00:05:11.440 know uh and feeling pressured that
00:05:14.240 you're letting the team
00:05:15.720 down by being sick or you have something
00:05:18.639 coming up and
00:05:20.680 um Amazon is really great in that it
00:05:24.160 takes it cuts that whole
00:05:26.960 uh stress out of employment and um it
00:05:31.360 puts it in your own lap you can take
00:05:35.680 control of your sick time your you know
00:05:39.039 your time off make your own decisions um
